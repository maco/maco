## Employment
I spent a while working on build systems for firewalls at Sourcefire/Cisco before moving back into web development. Newspapers have been a recurring thing: previously at The Washington Post, and now at Axios.

## Open Source
For several years, I was involved in Ubuntu development. Mainly, that meant QA, bug wrangling, and packaging releases. In that time, I submitted upstream patches to GNOME, KDE, and the Linux kernel. For a short while, I was on the board that decided who could have commit access.

Later, while learning Ruby on Rails, I became a maintainer on Growstuff and contributed to Spree. Nowadays, I'm using Elixir as my primary language.
