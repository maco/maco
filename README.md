## Open Source
I'm a former Ubuntu developer. Back in those days, I submitted patches to GNOME, KDE, and the Linux kernel. I used to hand out Ubuntu's commit bit. And now I have patches in Elixir and Erlang? That's weird.

## Past Work
I spent a while working on build systems for firewalls at Sourcefire/Cisco before moving back into web development. Newspapers have been a recurring thing: The Washington Post (twice) & Axios.
