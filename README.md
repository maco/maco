## Open Source
For several years, I was an Ubuntu developer. Mainly, that meant QA, bug wrangling, and packaging releases. In that time, I submitted patches to GNOME, KDE, and the Linux kernel. For a short while, I was on the board that decided who else could have commit access to Ubuntu. And now I have patches in Elixir and Erlang? That's weird.

## Past Work
I spent a while working on build systems for firewalls at Sourcefire/Cisco before moving back into web development. Newspapers have been a recurring thing: The Washington Post (twice) & Axios.
