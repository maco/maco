## Employment
Some of my better-known former employers include The Washington Post and Cisco. I've also spent some time in startups. 

## Open Source
For several years, I was involved in Ubuntu development. Mainly, that meant QA, bug wrangling, and packaging releases. In that time, I submitted upstream patches to GNOME, KDE, and the Linux kernel. For a short while, I was on the board that decided who could have commit access.

Later, while learning Ruby on Rails, I became a maintainer on Growstuff and contributed to Spree.
